    <h2>Hello world,</h2>
    <p>I'm Ahmad Reza. I was born in Iran and grew up there. I immigrated to America two years ago. When I came to America, I felt like a newborn baby. You can't imagine how difficult
    it was. I didn't have any friends and didn't know about the new language and culture. Even getting a driver's license, opening a bank account and finding a job were
    difficult projects, but a hit that don't kill you make you stronger and I got stronger.
    </p>
    <p>  I am getting more and more familiar with the new atmosphere every day and this new
    culture has helped me a lot. It took me about 2 years to find a job, make my credit,
    rent a house, buy a car, and so on, and now I'm getting where I am. I plan my future step by step.
    </p>

  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>  I love soccer and I run a few miles every day. 
    Working out help me to be more happy and more organized.  By getting know the programming courses in UCLA, I opened a new window for myself and entered a new world. 
    To be honest, after the first two sessions, I wanted to quit. It was very difficult for me to understand the language. I told myself this class is not just a programming class for me. This course is also English language class and introduction to American educational culture. I've hit multiple targets with one bullt and this is worthy more than a programming course. My teacher and TAs and my classmates help me a lot and now, I am proudly sharing my first site on the World Wide Web.
    This is my portfolio and I want to put all my homework here. I think it's ganna be very good gallery and perfect resume that will help me to find right job and hopfully I change my future .
